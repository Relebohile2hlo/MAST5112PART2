The Coastal Table App is a React Native-based mobile application designed for restaurant management, specifically focused on seafood restaurants with a relaxed, beachy vibe. The app allows restaurant chefs or managers to add and manage menu items, calculate the total cost of selected items, and view a dynamic list of available dishes. It focuses on providing an intuitive interface for managing starters and other dishes within the restaurant’s offerings.

This README will explain the various features, the code structure, and the development approach used in building the Coastal Table App. We will also provide reliable references that guided the design and implementation process.

2. App Overview
The Coastal Table App is developed as a single-screen mobile application in React Native. It incorporates functionalities such as:

Adding menu items with names, descriptions, and prices.
Automatically calculating the total cost of all items added.
Displaying the items added in a list using a FlatList component.
Using validation checks (if statements) to ensure that valid data is entered before the menu items are added.
Target Audience: The target audience for this app is restaurant chefs or owners who need an easy way to manage their seafood-centric menus and monitor prices on a day-to-day basis.

3. Features
3.1 Adding Menu Items
Users can add new menu items by filling out three fields:

Dish Name: Text input for the name of the dish.
Description: Text input to describe the dish.
Price: Numeric input for the price of the dish in the local currency.
The app performs validation to ensure all the fields are completed before adding an item to the list. This reduces the chance of errors such as missing names, descriptions, or invalid prices.

3.2 Validating User Input
The input fields are validated using if statements to prevent users from submitting incomplete or incorrect information. The checks include:

Empty strings for the dish name or description.
Invalid or non-numeric input for the price.
A feedback system using Alert to notify the user if they attempt to add an item without providing proper details.
3.3 Displaying Menu Items
Once items are added, they are displayed in a list format using FlatList. Each list item includes:

The dish name.
A short description of the dish.
The price, which is formatted to two decimal places.
This list allows the user to review and scroll through the menu items easily.

3.4 Automatic Price Calculation
The app calculates the total price of all the items added to the list. Each time a new item is added, the app updates the total and displays it at the bottom of the screen. This feature is useful for chefs or managers to keep track of costs without needing to calculate manually.

4. Code Structure
4.1 Main Component (App.tsx)
The entire functionality is contained within a single component (App.tsx), in line with the project's requirement to have one screen. The app utilizes React Native hooks to manage the state and logic.

Key Variables and States:
name: Stores the dish name input by the user.
description: Stores the description of the dish.
price: Stores the price input.
menuItems: An array to hold all the added menu items, including their name, description, and price.
total: A number representing the total price of all items in the list.
4.2 Adding New Items
The function addMenuItem is responsible for validating the input fields and adding the new item to the menuItems array if all conditions are met. Once the item is added, the total cost is updated using the price of the newly added item.

Here's how the validation works:

If any of the input fields (name, description, price) are empty, an alert is triggered, preventing the user from adding the item.
If all fields are valid, the item is added to the menuItems array, and the input fields are reset for the next entry.
4.3 Rendering the List of Items
The FlatList component is used to render the added menu items in a scrollable view. Each item in the list displays the name, description, and price of the dish. The unique id for each menu item is generated using Math.random() for simplicity, but this could be replaced by a more robust ID system in a real-world scenario.

4.4 Logo Integration
A logo image is added to the top of the screen using the Image component. The logo should be placed in the assets folder, and the require function is used to load it dynamically within the app.

Changes made and implementations from the feedback.

. Refactor Price Handling
Currently, the price input is a string (price), which gets converted to a number using parseFloat. This could lead to issues with invalid inputs (e.g., empty strings or non-numeric input). We can improve this by validating the input and ensuring it's a number.
2. Button and Course Selection
 using multiple Button components to select the course (starter, main, dessert). These buttons could be refactored to use a single button with a dropdown or a radio button approach, which will make the UI cleaner and easier to manage.
3. FlatList Optimization
If  list grows larger,  optimizing the FlatList by adding getItemLayout and initialNumToRender properties to improve performance.
4. Form Reset
 resetting the form fields (name, description, and price) individually after adding an item.  group the reset logic into a single function for better maintainability.
5. Error Handling for Price
Right now, if a user enters a non-numeric value for the price, it could break the functionality  should ensure the price input is a valid number before adding the item to the list.

CHANGES MADE
Price Validation and Error Handling
•	Change: Added a validation check for the price input before adding the item to the list.
•	Reasoning: Previously, the app allowed non-numeric or empty strings as valid prices, which could break the functionality or display incorrect results. By checking that the price is a valid positive number, we ensure the app functions as expected.
•	Implementation:
o	Used parseFloat(price) to convert the price input to a number.
o	If the price is invalid (e.g., NaN or a negative value), an error message is shown using Alert.alert(), preventing the addition of an invalid item.
2. Refactored Course Selection (Button Consolidation)
•	Change: Replaced individual Button components for each course (starter, main, dessert) with a map function that generates the buttons dynamically.
•	Reasoning: This refactor reduces the redundancy of code and improves maintainability. If there are any changes to the course types or new courses added, it will only require an update to the array and not each individual button.
•	Implementation:
o	Mapped over an array of course types (['starter', 'main', 'dessert']) and dynamically created buttons with Button components.
3. Consolidated Form Reset Logic
•	Change: Grouped the logic to reset form fields into a single resetForm function instead of resetting each state variable (name, description, price, course) separately.
•	Reasoning: This makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain, as all the form-reset logic is now in one place.
•	Implementation: Created a resetForm function to reset all form-related states at once, simplifying the logic after adding an item.
4. FlatList Performance Optimization
•	Change: Added initialNumToRender and getItemLayout to optimize FlatList performance.
•	Reasoning: As the list grows, performance can degrade if the app doesn't optimize the rendering of items. These changes make the list render more efficiently, particularly with a large number of items.
•	Implementation:
o	initialNumToRender={5}: Specifies the number of items to render initially (this can be adjusted based on the expected size of the list).
o	getItemLayout: Provides information about the height of each item in the list, which helps with performance, especially if the items have a fixed height.
***5. Error Handling for Price Input (Alert)***
•	Change: Introduced Alert.alert() to notify the user if the price is invalid (non-numeric or less than 0).
•	Reasoning: Previously, invalid price inputs could silently cause issues. Now, users are informed about incorrect input in a user-friendly way.
•	Implementation: If the price is invalid, an alert pops up with a message explaining the error, preventing the user from submitting the form until a valid price is entered.
6. Minor UI Enhancements
•	Change: Adjusted the structure of the course selection buttons to be more flexible and easier to manage.
•	Reasoning: By dynamically generating the buttons based o
•	Reasoning: By dynamically generating the buttons based on an array, the app is more scalable and easier to update in the future.
•	Implementation: The course buttons are now dynamically generated using a map() function over an array of course names.
